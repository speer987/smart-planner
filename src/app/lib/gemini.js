    contents: `You are given this quarterly plan that breaks a goal into 4 high-level quarterly objectives:
"${plan}".

Your task is to break down each quarterly objective into:
    - 3 monthly goals (one per month)
    - Each monthly goal should then be broken down into:
        - 4 weekly goals, one for each week of the month
        - Each weekly goal should then be broken down into:
            - Daily goals for every other day of the week, beginning on Monday (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri, Sun)

When breaking the yearly goal into quarterly goals, divide any numerical targets (like number of books, miles, lessons, etc.) so that the sum across all quarters equals the original target.

Guidelines:
    Monthly goals should:
      - Not begin with the name of the month (e.g., "January: ...")
      - Be specific, action-oriented, and build progressively toward the quarterly objective
      - Distribute the numerical target of the quarterly goal evenly (or logically) across the three months in that quarter (e.g., if the quarterly objective is "Read 5 books", the monthly goals should add up to 5 books — like "Read 2 books", "Read 2 books", and "Read 1 book").
      - Assume a full year to reach the main goal, and break it down accordingly.

    Weekly goals should:
      - Directly support the monthly goal
      - Be clear and measurable (e.g., “Practice drawing 3 times this week for 20 minutes”)

    Daily goals should:
      - Occur every other day, starting with Monday
      - Align with the weekly goal (e.g., if the weekly goal says “3 runs,” then daily goals should specify which days those runs happen)
      - Use “Rest” or leave blank on off days

    Return Format:
    Return a single JSON object structured exactly like this:

    {
      "Q1": {
        "January": {
          "monthly_goal": "January: ...",
